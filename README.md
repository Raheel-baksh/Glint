[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Raheel-baksh/Glint)](https://github.com/Raheel-baksh/Glint/releases)

Welcome to **Glint**, a high-performance Rust framework designed for building stateful, graph-based AI systems. With Glint, developers can create dynamic, multi-step workflows powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), embeddings, and vector stores. This framework operates through an asynchronous, checkpointable state machine, offering a robust foundation for constructing agent runtimes, autonomous pipelines, and complex control flows.

## Introduction

Glint is inspired by modern AI orchestration tools, focusing on performance and safety. Rustâ€™s zero-cost abstractions allow Glint to deliver predictable performance, thread safety, and fine-grained control over state transitions. Its graph-based architecture simplifies the modeling of conditional logic, parallel branches, and persistent memory, making it a composable and extensible framework.

## Features

- **Graph-based Workflows**: Build complex AI workflows using a graph-based architecture.
- **LLM Integration**: Support for OpenAI and other LLM providers.
- **Embeddings**: Generate and work with embeddings for semantic search.
- **Vector Stores**: Efficiently manage vector data for quick retrieval and processing.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking operations enhance performance.
- **Checkpointing**: Save and restore states during execution.
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rustâ€™s safety features to avoid common pitfalls.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new functionalities and integrate with existing systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with Glint, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and start building with Glint.

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Rust programming language.

## Installation

To install Glint, you can clone the repository and build it from source. Hereâ€™s how:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raheel-baksh/Glint.git
cd Glint
cargo build --release
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Raheel-baksh/Glint/releases). Make sure to execute the downloaded file according to your operating system guidelines.

## Usage

Once you have Glint installed, you can start building your workflows. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate its usage:

```rust
use glint::workflow::{Workflow, Step};

fn main() {
    let mut workflow = Workflow::new();

    let step1 = Step::new("Step 1")
        .execute(|| {
            println!("Executing Step 1");
        });

    let step2 = Step::new("Step 2")
        .execute(|| {
            println!("Executing Step 2");
        });

    workflow.add_step(step1);
    workflow.add_step(step2);

    workflow.run();
}
```

This example creates a basic workflow with two steps. Each step prints a message when executed. You can build upon this foundation to create more complex workflows.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of what you can achieve with Glint:

### Example 1: Conditional Logic

You can model conditional logic using Glintâ€™s graph-based architecture. Hereâ€™s how:

```rust
use glint::workflow::{Workflow, Step};

fn main() {
    let mut workflow = Workflow::new();

    let decision_step = Step::new("Decision")
        .execute(|| {
            // Some logic to determine the path
            true // or false based on your logic
        });

    let true_branch = Step::new("True Branch")
        .execute(|| {
            println!("Executing True Branch");
        });

    let false_branch = Step::new("False Branch")
        .execute(|| {
            println!("Executing False Branch");
        });

    workflow.add_step(decision_step);
    workflow.add_step(true_branch).if_condition(true);
    workflow.add_step(false_branch).if_condition(false);

    workflow.run();
}
```

### Example 2: Parallel Execution

Glint allows for parallel execution of steps. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```rust
use glint::workflow::{Workflow, Step};

fn main() {
    let mut workflow = Workflow::new();

    let step1 = Step::new("Step 1")
        .execute(|| {
            println!("Executing Step 1");
        });

    let step2 = Step::new("Step 2")
        .execute(|| {
            println!("Executing Step 2");
        });

    workflow.add_step(step1).parallel();
    workflow.add_step(step2).parallel();

    workflow.run();
}
```

In this example, both steps execute simultaneously.
